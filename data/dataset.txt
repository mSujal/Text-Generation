I think, therefore I am. This is the first principle of philosophy, the foundation upon which all knowledge must be built. We cannot doubt our own existence while we are doubting, for doubt itself requires a doubter.

The unexamined life is not worth living. To live without questioning, without reflection upon our actions and beliefs, is to live as mere animals, driven by instinct rather than reason.

Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. Society corrupts the natural goodness of humanity, imposing artificial constraints that bind us to inequality and servitude.

To be is to be perceived. Nothing exists independently of mind or consciousness. Material objects are nothing more than collections of ideas perceived by thinking beings.

The only thing I know is that I know nothing. True wisdom begins with the recognition of one's own ignorance, for only then can we begin to seek genuine knowledge.

God is dead. We have killed him with our science and our reason. Now we must create new values, for the old foundations have crumbled beneath our feet.

What can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence. The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.

All men by nature desire to know. We are rational animals, and reason is what distinguishes us from the beasts. The contemplative life is the highest form of human existence.

Entities should not be multiplied without necessity. The simplest explanation is usually the correct one. We should not assume the existence of more things than are needed to explain phenomena.

That which does not kill us makes us stronger. Life is struggle, and through overcoming obstacles we become who we truly are. Embrace suffering as the path to greatness.

The categorical imperative demands that we act only according to maxims we could will to be universal laws. Treat humanity always as an end in itself, never merely as a means.

Life is absurd. There is no inherent meaning in the universe, yet we desperately search for purpose. We must imagine Sisyphus happy, finding meaning in the struggle itself.

Hell is other people. We are condemned to be free, thrust into existence without essence or predetermined nature. Our relationships with others trap us in patterns of bad faith.

The master-slave dialectic reveals the nature of consciousness. Through struggle for recognition, self-consciousness emerges. History is the progressive realization of freedom.

All is flux, nothing stays still. You cannot step into the same river twice, for fresh waters are ever flowing upon you. Change is the only constant in existence.

The greatest happiness principle: actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse. The ends justify the means.

The veil of ignorance allows us to determine justice. If we did not know our place in society, what principles would we choose? This is how we derive fair institutions.

The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.

Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. All phenomena arise through dependent origination, lacking inherent existence. Suffering comes from attachment to the illusion of permanence.

The Superman must arise to replace the old values. We need philosophers who command and legislate, who create values rather than merely discovering them.

Perception is reality. The world we experience is constructed by our minds from sensory data. There is no way to know if our perceptions correspond to an external reality.

The social contract is an agreement among individuals to form a society. We surrender certain freedoms in exchange for protection and the benefits of cooperation.

Being and nothingness are intertwined. Consciousness is nothingness, a lack of being, yet through this nothingness we create meaning and project ourselves into the future.

The sublime reveals the limits of reason. When confronted with the infinite or overwhelming, our imagination fails, yet reason recognizes what imagination cannot grasp.

All that is solid melts into air. The capitalist mode of production creates constant revolution in social relations. The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing production.

The cave allegory illustrates our condition. We are prisoners, seeing only shadows on the wall, mistaking them for reality. Philosophy is the journey from darkness into light.

Doubt everything until you arrive at clear and distinct ideas. Method is essential to philosophy. We must build knowledge on certain foundations, not speculation.

The general will represents the common good, distinct from the will of all. True freedom is obedience to laws we prescribe to ourselves as members of the political community.

Phenomena are appearances; noumena are things in themselves. We can never know the thing in itself, only how it appears to us through the categories of understanding.

Care is the fundamental structure of existence. We are thrown into the world, always already engaged with things and others, projecting ourselves toward future possibilities.

The principle of sufficient reason: nothing is without a reason why it is rather than is not. For everything that exists, there must be an explanation for its existence.

Truth is what works. Ideas are tools, not mirrors of reality. We should judge beliefs by their practical consequences, not by correspondence to some absolute truth.

The other is fundamental to self-knowledge. Through the gaze of others, we become aware of ourselves as objects. This creates shame and the desire for recognition.

Innate ideas exist prior to experience. The mind is not a blank slate but contains knowledge structures that organize sensory input into meaningful experience.

The sovereign must have absolute power to prevent the war of all against all. Without a common power to keep us in awe, life is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

The phenomenological reduction brackets existence claims. We study consciousness as it appears, suspending judgment about the external world to examine pure experience.

Language games constitute forms of life. The meaning of words is their use in practice. Philosophical problems arise from misunderstanding the grammar of our language.

The will to power is the fundamental drive. Life is not preservation but expansion, the desire to grow stronger, to overcome resistance, to dominate and create.

Liberty consists in doing what one desires. Political freedom is the absence of interference by others. The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over others is to prevent harm.

The ideal speech situation provides conditions for rational discourse. When communication is free from domination, consensus reached represents genuine truth and justice.

Monads are windowless substances that do not interact but develop according to pre-established harmony. Each monad mirrors the universe from its unique perspective.

The eternal return: what if this life repeated infinitely? Would you curse the demon who told you, or would you affirm existence completely? This is the ultimate test.

Mind and body are two aspects of one substance. God or Nature is the only substance, and thought and extension are attributes of this single reality.

The noble lie is necessary for social cohesion. Philosophers should rule because only they understand the Forms, the eternal unchanging patterns that physical things imperfect.

Pragmatism dissolves metaphysical disputes. If no practical difference follows from one view or another, the dispute is meaningless. Cash value is what matters.

The dialectic proceeds through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Contradictions drive development toward higher unity. Spirit realizes itself through historical progression.

We are beings-toward-death. Authenticity requires confronting mortality. Most people flee this truth through distraction and conformity to the anonymous masses.

The principle of utility provides the foundation for morals and legislation. We should calculate consequences and maximize overall happiness or pleasure in society.

Compassion is the basis of morality. We should minimize suffering in all sentient beings. The veil of Maya blinds us to our fundamental unity with all existence.

The cogito is indubitable. Even if a demon deceives me about everything, I must exist to be deceived. Self-awareness provides the starting point for certain knowledge.

Justice is the interest of the stronger. Morality is a tool used by the powerful to control the weak. The natural state is conflict, and might makes right.

The stream of consciousness flows continuously. There is no substantial self, only a series of connected mental states. Personal identity is a convenient fiction.

Difference precedes identity. Repetition is never exact but always involves difference. Being is multiplicity, and concepts impose artificial unity on flux.

The gift must be without reciprocity or recognition. True giving cannot expect return. The logic of exchange corrupts generosity into economy and calculation.

Substance is primary, and accidents are modifications. Individual things are substances that persist through change, bearing properties that may vary over time.

The public sphere enables rational-critical debate. Democratic legitimacy requires open communication where citizens can deliberate freely about common concerns without state control.

Evil is merely the privation of good. Nothing exists that is essentially evil. All being is good insofar as it exists; corruption is a lack or absence.

Women's subordination is constructed, not natural. Gender roles are social impositions that deny female autonomy and potential. Liberation requires recognizing equal rationality and rights.

The face of the Other makes ethical demands. Before concepts or comprehension, we encounter the vulnerable other who commands "do not kill me" and calls us to responsibility.

Clear thinking requires clear language. Many philosophical problems result from confused grammar. Analysis can dissolve pseudo-problems by clarifying logical form and meaning.

The lifeworld is the pre-theoretical background. Science and reason emerge from this taken-for-granted everyday experience that provides the horizon for all understanding and action.

Cybernetics and systems theory reveal feedback loops in nature and society. Information, not matter or energy, is fundamental. We are patterns that persist in flow.

The society of the spectacle alienates us from authentic experience. Mediated images replace direct life, reducing everything to commodity and representation in capital.

The rhizome grows horizontally without center or hierarchy. Traditional tree-like thinking imposes false order. Reality is multiplicity, connection, heterogeneity without unity or foundation.

Deconstruction reveals the instability of meaning. Binary oppositions conceal hierarchies. Texts undermine their own claims. Nothing escapes the play of différance and traces.

The hermeneutic circle: we understand parts through the whole and the whole through parts. Interpretation is always situated within tradition and pre-understanding that enables and limits grasp.

Truth is unconcealment, aletheia. Being reveals itself while concealing. Technology frames everything as standing-reserve, resources for manipulation rather than letting things be.

The trace is neither presence nor absence. Writing precedes speech. There is no origin or center, only endless deferral and difference in chains of signification without ground.

Biopower manages populations through disciplinary mechanisms. Modern power operates through normalization rather than sovereign command. Bodies are sites of political intervention and control.

The mirror stage creates the ego. The child identifies with its reflection, forming imaginary unity. This alienated self-image becomes the basis for future identifications in symbolic order.

Orientalism constructs the East as exotic Other. Western representation creates object of study and domination. Knowledge and power are inseparable in colonial discourse and practice.

Performativity constitutes gender identity. Repetition of acts creates illusion of stable essence. Subversion requires exposing and varying the regulated repetition that produces subject.

The flaneur wanders the urban landscape. Modernity creates new experiences of space and time. Crowds, commodity culture, and spectacle transform consciousness and perception in cities.

Simulation precedes and generates the real. Hyperreality replaces reality with signs and models. The map precedes the territory. Images have no relation to reality anymore.

Ressentiment drives slave morality. The weak, unable to act, revalue strength as evil and weakness as good. Genealogy reveals the psychological origins hiding behind moral concepts.

The iron cage of rationality traps modern society. Instrumental reason and bureaucracy dominate, excluding values and meaning. Disenchantment leaves us without purpose or freedom.

Cultural hegemony maintains power through consent. The ruling class shapes common sense and ideology. Intellectuals can be organic, emerging from classes, or traditional, seeming autonomous.

Paradigm shifts structure scientific revolutions. Normal science operates within accepted frameworks. Anomalies accumulate until crisis forces new paradigm, incommensurable with the old.

The panopticon enables surveillance and discipline. The few observe the many who cannot see observers. Internalized gaze creates self-policing subjects. Architecture materializes power relations.

Speech acts do things with words. Performatives like promising or declaring constitute reality. Conditions determine whether utterances succeed or misfire. Language is action, not just description.

Second-wave feminism critiques patriarchy across domains. The personal is political. Gender inequality pervades family, work, sexuality. Consciousness-raising reveals shared oppression requiring collective action.

Intersectionality examines overlapping oppressions. Race, class, gender, and other identities interact. Single-axis analysis misses how systems of domination interconnect and compound marginalization.

The linguistic turn made language central. Philosophy became analysis of meaning and communication. Reality is mediated through language which shapes thought and limits possible understanding.

Communitarians challenge liberal individualism. Selves are embedded in communities and traditions. Rights discourse neglects responsibilities and the social constitution of identity and values.

Capabilities approach measures welfare by functioning opportunities. Justice requires not just resources but real freedoms to achieve valuable beings and doings reflecting human dignity.

Post-colonial theory examines legacy of imperialism. Hybrid identities and cultural mixing characterize the post-colonial condition. Subaltern voices challenge dominant narratives and western universalism.

Queer theory questions fixed sexual and gender identities. Heteronormativity structures society and thought. Fluidity and transgression resist categories. Identity is performance without original or essence.

Standpoint epistemology values marginalized perspectives. Social location shapes knowledge. The oppressed see both dominant and subjugated worlds. Situated knowledge is strong objectivity.

The precautionary principle guides technology policy. Burden of proof lies with proponents of new interventions. Uncertainty about harm justifies caution even without definitive evidence of risk.

Virtue ethics emphasizes character over rules or consequences. Flourishing requires developing virtues through practice and habituation. The virtuous person perceives and acts rightly through wisdom.

Care ethics values relationships and responsibilities. Abstract rules miss moral particularity. Empathy, attention, and responsiveness characterize ethical care. Feminist thinkers developed care as alternative framework.

Deep ecology extends moral consideration to ecosystems. Anthropocentrism must give way to biocentrism. Humans are part of nature, not separate or superior. Intrinsic value inheres in all living things.

The Anthropocene marks human geological impact. Climate change and mass extinction result from industrial civilization. New epoch requires rethinking human-nature relations and planetary stewardship.

Effective altruism uses reason to maximize good. Calculate expected value and donate to most effective causes. Impartiality requires weighing distant suffering equally with near concerns.

Experimental philosophy tests intuitions empirically. Traditional armchair methods ignore how people actually think. Cultural and demographic variations challenge claimed universal philosophical truths.

The hard problem of consciousness remains unsolved. Physical processes don't explain subjective experience. Why is there something it is like to be conscious? Qualia resist reductive explanation.

Eliminative materialism denies folk psychology. Mental states like beliefs and desires don't exist. Neuroscience will replace psychological explanations with better theories of brain function and behavior.
